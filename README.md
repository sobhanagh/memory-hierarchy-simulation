# üß† Memory Hierarchy Simulation  

This project is a **JavaScript implementation** of a memory hierarchy simulation. It models a multi-level cache system with different cache levels (L1, L2, L3), main memory (RAM), and disk storage. The simulation allows users to configure the cache levels, sizes, block size, and replacement policies, and then simulate memory accesses to observe the performance in terms of hits, misses, and total access time.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Configure the cache levels, sizes, block size, and replacement policy using the input fields.
3. Click the **"Simulate"** button to start the simulation.
4. View the results, including hits, misses, and total access time, displayed on the page.
5. The results are also visualized in a **bar chart**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

* **Cache Levels:** Number of cache levels (1, 2, or 3).
* **Cache Size L1:** Size of the L1 cache in bytes.
* **Cache Size L2:** Size of the L2 cache in bytes (if applicable).
* **Cache Size L3:** Size of the L3 cache in bytes (if applicable).
* **Block Size:** Size of each cache block in bytes.
* **Replacement Policy:** Cache replacement policy (FIFO, LRU, MRU, Random, LFRU).

---

## üìä Simulation Details

The simulation performs a series of memory accesses and tracks the performance metrics:

* **Hits:** Number of times the requested data is found in the cache.
* **Misses:** Number of times the requested data is not found in the cache.
* **Total Time:** Total time taken for all memory accesses, considering the delays for each cache level, RAM, and disk.
